Test basic control of cwdaemon process:
1. starting of cwdaemon process with some command line options,
2. stopping of cwdaemon process through EXIT (esc + '5') request.

The first sub-test is mostly for the benefit of other cwdaemon tests - we
really want to know that a cwdaemon process can be started successfully.

The second part checks if esc+'5' request which is part of official, public
"interface" to cwdaemon is correctly causing cwdaemon to exit.
