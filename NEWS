cwdaemon 0.10.1 / 2014.04.23

New release. Changes since previous release:

* Fixing bug #1 reported by Pino Zollo ZP4KFX: cwdaemon failed to
  properly respond to <ESC>f Escape request. Attempting to change
  sound system used by cwdaemon caused the program to completely go
  silent and to not to send replies.

* Fixing bug #2 also reported by Pino Zollo ZP4KFX: cwdaemon has been
  sending replies too early, sometimes right after starting to play
  Morse characters (i.e. not waiting for end of playing the
  characters). This problem has been fixed by changes in cwdaemon
  source code, as well as by changes in unixcw/libcw source code (this
  is why you should use libcw version 6.1.1 from unixcw 3.3.1).

* Fixing bug #3 also reported by Pino Zollo ZP4KFX: description of
  escaped request for word mode in man page has been incorrect (wrong
  code of request). This has been fixed.

* Fixing bug #4, this one discovered by me: cwdaemon failed to
  correctly close network socket at exit. This has been fixed.

Many thanks to Pino Zollo ZP4KFX for reporting bugs in cwdaemon 0.10.0
and taking time to test fixes.

cwdaemon 0.10.0 / 2014.01.15

New release. Changes since previous release:

* Empty name of keying device sent with "8" network request shouldn't
  cause cwdaemon to crash anymore. Handling of empty/invalid keying
  device name has been improved.

* Until now if cwdaemon was called with invalid / unsupported /
  non-available sound system, it could start with misconfigured sound
  system. Now cwdaemon exits when it cannot open a sound system during
  start.

* When cwdaemon receives "switch to sound system X" network request,
  and it fails to correctly switch to the sound system, it falls back
  to "Null" audio system. The fall back eliminates possibility of
  crashing on attempt to use uninitialized sound system.

* Handling of "ptt delay" parameter has changed. Until now when value
  sent in network request was negative, the delay has been set to MAX.
  Now the negative value sent with network request is ignored.  When
  the negative value has been passed through command line argument,
  cwdaemon exits.

* Debug strings can be now printed to stdout (default, was already
  available), stderr, or disc file. Check -f / --debugfile command
  line option for more information.

* Verbosity level of debug messages can be controlled with command
  line options.

* cwdaemon now accepts --long-options on systems that support this
  functionality.

* Help text printed when calling cwdaemon with "-h" command line
  argument has been expanded.

* Man page for cwdaemon has been expanded.

This version of cwdaemon has been tested with libcw6.

cwdaemon 0.9.7 / 2013.01.11

New release.
The reason for this release is fixing some bugs reported by Thomas Beierlein:
 - <ESC>30 request has been setting volume to zero, but it was impossible
   to re-set the volume to non-zero value (e.g. with <ESC>3440). This now
   has been fixed.
 - reply mechanism replying to <ESC>h requests wasn't working correctly.
   Behaviour of the reply mechanism has been improved.
A Perl script testing cwdaemon (test/cwtest.pl) has greatly improved in the
process of fixing the second issue.

This version of cwdaemon is intended to be used with libcw5.
This version of cwdaemon has been barely tested by main developer.

cwdaemon 0.9.6 / 2012.07.04

New release.
Most of the changes in the release were introduced by Jenö Vágó, HA5SE
The changes include:
 - improved behaviour of PTT function,
 - completed implementation of basics of handshaking between cwdaemon and
   client application; this should allow the client application e.g. to send
   message char-by-char;
 - fixing some side effects of previously applied patches.

This version of cwdaemon is intended to be used with libcw4.
This version of cwdaemon has been barely tested by main developer.

cwdaemon (0.9.4)

  * Cwdaemon has been ported to the latest version of unixcw, version 2.3.
    First you need to configure and install unixcw, which adds the unixcw
    development library and headers to your system. When running cwdaemon's
    'configure', unixcw will be automatically included.
    See the INSTALL file for unixcw details.
  * Aborting (ESC4) has been improved by using select(). Cwdaemon will now
    abort even when in the middle of sending a character.
  * PTT has been implemented outside the unixcw libraries. This is untested,
    footswitch is also untested in this release.

cwdaemon (0.9.3)

  * This is a debian-only maintenance release.

cwdaemon (0.9.2)

  * Many patches by Jason L. Wright, AI4JW, which brings us OpenBSD support
    (you will need OpenBSD-current or the upcoming OpenBSD-3.7) and the
    following:
  * Better command line parsing and error checking added.
  * The 'none' sound device had been added in case you don't want a sidetone.
  * Free entry of portnames has been added, together with autodetection of
    ports. This should give is support for more platforms.
  * Many minor bugfixes.
  * A null device has been added, in case you want sidetone, but no keying
    (see 'man cwdaemon').

cwdaemon (0.9.1)

  * Fixes a possible buffer overflow.

cwdaemon (0.9)

  * ESCh will send echo to the program using cwdaemon when CW playing is done,
    using the '^' character. Added by Lada, OK1ZIA. This is used by tucnak,
    a VHF contest logging program, see http://tucnak.nagano.cz.
  * Debian init.d bootscript added by Lada, together with /etc/default/cwdaemon,
    which you can use to configure cwdaemon. Set START_CWDAEMON=no in
    /etc/default/cwdaemon to disable start at boottime.
  * Serial and parallel port now supported on FreeBSD. Parallel port and various
    BSD fixes thanks to Diane Bruce, VA3DB.

cwdaemon (0.8)

  * Cwdaemon is now integrated with unixcw, see cwlib.c and cwlib.h.
    Weighting has been added to unixcw and some special characters needed
    by cwdaemon. The choppiness reported in previous versions of cwdaemon is
    fixed. And we have soundcard support!
  * Better handling of aborting messages.
  * Weighting now uses a value of -50 to 50.
  * 2 extra command line options: -v for volume and -x for sound device.
  * 2 extra escape sequences for controlling cwdaemon: ESCfx for switching the
    sound output on the fly and ESCgx for setting the soundcard volume.
  * Tune (ESCc) now uses seconds as an argument, e.g. ESCc1 tunes 1 second,
    ESCc10 tunes 10 seconds. Maximum tune value is 10 seconds.
  * A fix by Lada, OK1ZIA for big endian systems.
  * Footswitch support by Wolf, DL2WRJ (pin 15 of the parallel port).
  * New morse character '@' has been added.
  * Process priority of cwdaemon can be set with the -P flag. You can try this
    if you experience timing problems.

cwdaemon (0.7)

  * Band info output on pins 2, 7, 8, 9 of the parallel port
    (pin 2 = lsb, 9 = msb, e.g. 1000 = 160m, 1001 = 10m).
    Patch by Rein Couperus, PA0R.
  * Corrected the parallel port schematic for PTT switching.

 -- Joop Stakenborg <pg4i@amsat.org>  Sun, 26 Oct 2003 16:37:51 +0100

cwdaemon (0.6)

  * POSIX compliant in/output is now used for the serial and parallel port,
    which means that cwdaemon should now run on any hardware that runs linux.
    Please read the README for serial/parallel port setup.
  * Debian: set architecture to 'any'.

cwdaemon (0.5)

  * Patch by Ladislav Vaiz, OK1ZIA <ok1zia@nagano.cz>:
  * Adds a pin to the lpt port for switching between a soundcard and
    microphone, uses ESCb escape code.
  * Lada has also split the code into separate files for the serial and
    parallel port.
  * Buffer overflows were fixed.
  * New escape codes: ESC8: device type, ESC9: base port number.
  * Work by Rolf, DL2WRJ:
  * ESCa: PTT on/off, ESCc: tuning on/off, ESCd: PTT delay.

 -- Joop Stakenborg <pa3aba@debian.org>  Sun, 11 May 2003 15:48:47 +0200

cwdaemon (0.4)

  * Support for /dev/lp1 parallel port added.
  * Add weighting. This can be set from the command line (-w switch) or
    from an application using ESC7. Values are from -5 to 5. Contributed by
    DL2WRJ.
  * Speed in/decrease is set at 2 wpm intervals.
  * Halfspace delay has been added, which simply adds half of the dash time
    to the delay after each sign send. You have to use the '~' for that.
    See the README. Contributed by DL2WRJ. Thanks Wolf!
  * New serial schematic with port protection and better keying.
  * Also build a debian package on alpha.

 -- Joop Stakenborg <pa3aba@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Apr 2003 20:57:20 +0200

cwdaemon (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support added for serial ports, contributed by Wolf-Ruediger Juergens,
    DL2WRJ <WJuergens at t-online.de>. This brings a new command line option:
    -d <device>. Device should be one of ttyS0, ttyS1 or lp0.
  * New function: errmsg for writing to the syslog or console when not forked.
  * Getopt is now used for command line parsing. Some checks added for correct
    UDP port values.
  * The dot-dash delay has been adjusted, so it sounds a bit better.

cwdaemon (0.2.3)

  * Fix a bug reported by Wilbert Knol <zl2bsj at zl2tze.ath.cx>, cwdaemon
    would 'remember' previous lines, if they are longer than the current one.
  * Add some command line arguments (see cwdaemon -h). The default port can
    now be changed with '-p', '-n' will cause cwdaemon not to fork and print
    debug information to stdout.
  * Many cleanups (up till here 0.2.2 test release).
  * Fixed a divide by zero which would crash cwdaemon.
  * Use nanosleep instead of usleep.
