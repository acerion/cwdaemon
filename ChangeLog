	* configuration: Unification of configuration via command line and
	through socket.

	Parameters of cwdaemon can be changed using either command line
	switches, or requests sent through socket. Some of parameters can
	be changed using both ways. Handling the two ways is implemented
	in two different places, and some code was duplicated.
	I have reused some functions that handled only command line
	arguments to also handle requests sent through pipe.
	I have also modified some debug messages printed on receiving
	invalid configuration values, so that the messages have similar
	format.

	* command line options: added support for --long-options.

2013-12-20 Kamil Ignacak
	* debug code: symblic names as verbosity debug levels;
	cwdaemon_debug() now can write to stdout and to disc file;
	cwdaemon_debug() accepts __line__ and __FILE__. Three new command
	line options related to debugging (verbosity level, libcw debug
	flags, output debug file).

2013-12-17 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: renaming configure.in to configure.ac Making some
	other small changes so that current source code (which - so far -
	is still 0.9.7) can build without warnings.
	* debian/* files: upgrading content of control and init.d files to
	cleanly build Debian package.

	Since now I have a cleanly "buildable" source code tree, I can
	proceed with hacking the code.

2012-12-30 Kamil Ignacak
	* testing: improving test/cwtest.pl script - more test cases,
	checking replies from server, multiple repetitions of test cases
	in a loop.
	* functionality: restoring functionality from 0.9.4: reply from
	cwdaemon to a "<ESC>h" escape request starts with character "h".
	This small piece of functionality was missing from post-0.9.4
	releases.

2012-12-29 Kamil Ignacak
	* <ESC>h Some changes that fix problems related to callback
	mechanism replying to <ESC>h sequence. The problems were reported
	by Thomas Beierlein (thank you!).

2012-11-18 Kamil Ignacak
	* <ESC>30 is setting volume to zero, but it was impossible to re-set
	the volume to non-zero value (e.g. with <ESC>3440). This now has been
	fixed. The problem has been reported by Thomas Beierlein (thanks!).

2012-07-04 Kamil Ignacak
	* after performing some tests it turned out that cwdaemon sends
	malformed replies; three changes in src/cwdaemon.c fix this
	problem;

2012-07-03 Kamil Ignacak
	* preparing cwdaemon for new release - few updates in various files.

2012-06-18 Kamil Ignacak
	* audio: it was possible in previous versions of cwdaemon that after
	forking cwdaemon didn't produce any sound. This is now fixed.
	* tests: further clean up in 'test/': removing binary files.

2012-06-17 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: somewhere around 17.06 I have cleaned up a bit contents of
	'test/'; Two *.c files have been merged into one, Makefile files have
	been added.

2012-06-16 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: added "-std=C99" compilation flag.
	Temporarily enabling more warnings.

2012-06-12 Kamil Ignacak
	* escape codes: until now, whenever client has sent request to
	change tone, cwdaemon has been also resetting volume to default value.
	This has been changed - in such situation volume is not reset, you
	need to send separate escape code to change volume.

2012-06-11 Kamil Ignacak
	* options: implementing option '-T', setting initial tone used by
	cwdaemon.

2012-06-10 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: introducing directories "src" and "doc", moving few
	files to the directories.

2012-06-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* audio system: improving selection/control of audio system: user can
	now specify (through command line arguments or through control data
	sent via socket) audio system: OSS, ALSA or PulseAudio (in addition to
	options available until now: console, soundcard, none).

2012-06-04 Kamil Ignacak
	* It seems that all changes from Jenö have been added to source code
	three. Proceeding with small improvements and comments.

2012-06-04 Kamil Ignacak
	* Jenö Vágó has sent me a set of changes that he has made to cwdaemon.
	The changes improve cwdaemon in many ways and have been tested by
	Jenö during his work with cwdaemon. I owe him many thanks for the
	changes and for insightful comments about the application and about
	operation of HAM stations in general.
	During application of the changes to git source tree I have also
	modified formatting, spaces, names and other minor items. I think
	that I've applied all changes, but I will check this again later.

2012-04-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* general: committing files from cwdaemon_0.9.4.orig.tar.gz and
	cwdaemon_0.9.4-9.debian.tar.gz to git repository on Sourceforge.
	* patching: applying patches from debian/patches:
	01-Removed-bashism-from-cwsetup.patch by Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>
	02-libcw3-transition.patch by Kamil Ignacak <acerion@wp.pl>
	03-generator-start.patch by Jenö Vago <ha5se@ha5hrk.hu>
	04-buffer-end.patch by Jenö Vago <ha5se@ha5hrk.hu>
	05-ptt-off-wait.patch by Jenö Vago <ha5se@ha5hrk.hu>
	06-install-scripts-as-scripts.patch by Kamal Mostafa <kamal@whence.com>
	Since the patches have been applied, I will remove them.
	* debian/: upgrading debian/* files.
