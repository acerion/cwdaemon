cwdaemon (0.9.4)

  * Cwdaemon has been ported to the latest version of unixcw, version 2.3.
    First you need to configure and install unixcw, which adds the unixcw
    development library and headers to your system. When running cwdaemon's
    'configure', unixcw will be automatically included.
    See the INSTALL file for unixcw details.
  * Aborting (ESC4) has been improved by using select(). Cwdaemon will now
    abort even when in the middle of sending a character.
  * PTT has been implemented outside the unixcw libraries. This is untested,
    footswitch is also untested in this release.

cwdaemon (0.9.3)

  * This is a debian-only maintenance release.

cwdaemon (0.9.2)

  * Many patches by Jason L. Wright, AI4JW, which brings us OpenBSD support
    (you will need OpenBSD-current or the upcoming OpenBSD-3.7) and the
    following:
  * Better command line parsing and error checking added.
  * The 'none' sound device had been added in case you don't want a sidetone.
  * Free entry of portnames has been added, together with autodetection of
    ports. This should give is support for more platforms.
  * Many minor bugfixes.
  * A null device has been added, in case you want sidetone, but no keying
    (see 'man cwdaemon').

cwdaemon (0.9.1)

  * Fixes a possible buffer overflow.

cwdaemon (0.9)

  * ESCh will send echo to the program using cwdaemon when CW playing is done,
    using the '^' character. Added by Lada, OK1ZIA. This is used by tucnak,
    a VHF contest logging program, see http://tucnak.nagano.cz.
  * Debian init.d bootscript added by Lada, together with /etc/default/cwdaemon,
    which you can use to configure cwdaemon. Set START_CWDAEMON=no in 
    /etc/default/cwdaemon to disable start at boottime.
  * Serial and parallel port now supported on FreeBSD. Parallel port and various
    BSD fixes thanks to Diane Bruce, VA3DB.

cwdaemon (0.8)

  * Cwdaemon is now integrated with unixcw, see cwlib.c and cwlib.h.
    Weighting has been added to unixcw and some special characters needed
    by cwdaemon. The choppiness reported in previous versions of cwdaemon is
    fixed. And we have soundcard support!
  * Better handling of aborting messages.
  * Weighting now uses a value of -50 to 50.
  * 2 extra command line options: -v for volume and -x for sound device.
  * 2 extra escape sequences for controlling cwdaemon: ESCfx for switching the
    sound output on the fly and ESCgx for setting the soundcard volume.
  * Tune (ESCc) now uses seconds as an argument, e.g. ESCc1 tunes 1 second,
    ESCc10 tunes 10 seconds. Maximum tune value is 10 seconds.
  * A fix by Lada, OK1ZIA for big endian systems.
  * Footswitch support by Wolf, DL2WRJ (pin 15 of the parallel port).
  * New morse character '@' has been added.
  * Process priority of cwdaemon can be set with the -P flag. You can try this
    if you experience timing problems.

cwdaemon (0.7)

  * Band info output on pins 2, 7, 8, 9 of the parallel port
    (pin 2 = lsb, 9 = msb, e.g. 1000 = 160m, 1001 = 10m).
    Patch by Rein Couperus, PA0R.
  * Corrected the parallel port schematic for PTT switching.

cwdaemon (0.6)

  * POSIX compliant in/output is now used for the serial and parallel port,
    which means that cwdaemon should now run on any hardware that runs linux.
    Please read the README for serial/parallel port setup.
  * Debian: set architecture to 'any'.

cwdaemon (0.5)

  * Patch by Ladislav Vaiz, OK1ZIA <ok1zia@nagano.cz>:
  * Adds a pin to the lpt port for switching between a soundcard and
    microphone, uses ESCb escape code.
  * Lada has also split the code into separate files for the serial and
    parallel port.
  * Buffer overflows were fixed.
  * New escape codes: ESC8: device type, ESC9: base port number.
  * Work by Rolf, DL2WRJ:
  * ESCa: PTT on/off, ESCc: tuning on/off, ESCd: PTT delay.

cwdaemon (0.4)

  * Support for /dev/lp1 parallel port added.
  * Add weighting. This can be set from the command line (-w switch) or
    from an application using ESC7. Values are from -5 to 5. Contributed by
    DL2WRJ.
  * Speed in/decrease is set at 2 wpm intervals.
  * Halfspace delay has been added, which simply adds half of the dash time
    to the delay after each sign send. You have to use the '~' for that.
    See the README. Contributed by DL2WRJ. Thanks Wolf!
  * New serial schematic with port protection and better keying.
  * Also build a debian package on alpha.

cwdaemon (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support added for serial ports, contributed by Wolf-Ruediger Juergens,
    DL2WRJ <WJuergens at t-online.de>. This brings a new command line option:
    -d <device>. Device should be one of ttyS0, ttyS1 or lp0.
  * New function: errmsg for writing to the syslog or console when not forked.
  * Getopt is now used for command line parsing. Some checks added for correct
    UDP port values.
  * The dot-dash delay has been adjusted, so it sounds a bit better.

cwdaemon (0.2.3)

  * Fix a bug reported by Wilbert Knol <zl2bsj at zl2tze.ath.cx>, cwdaemon
    would 'remember' previous lines, if they are longer than the current one.
  * Add some command line arguments (see cwdaemon -h). The default port can 
    now be changed with '-p', '-n' will cause cwdaemon not to fork and print
    debug information to stdout.
  * Many cleanups (up till here 0.2.2 test release).
  * Fixed a divide by zero which would crash cwdaemon.
  * Use nanosleep instead of usleep.

 -- Joop Stakenborg <pa3aba@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Mar 2003 21:26:24 +0100
