	* Jenö Vágó has sent me a set of changes that he has made to cwdaemon.
	The changes improve cwdaemon in many ways and have been tested by
	Jenö during his work with cwdaemon. I owe him many thanks for the
	changes and for insightful comments about the application and about
	operation of HAM stations in general.
	During application of the changes to git source tree I have also
	modified formatting, spaces, names and other minor items. I think
	that I've applied all changes, but I will check this again later.
