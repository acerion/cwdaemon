	* audio: it was possible in previous versions of cwdaemon that after
	forking cwdaemon didn't produce any sound. This is now fixed.
	* tests: further clean up in 'test/': removing binary files.

2012-06-17 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: somewhere around 17.06 I have cleaned up a bit contents of
	'test/'; Two *.c files have been merged into one, Makefile files have
	been added.

2012-06-16 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: added "-std=C99" compilation flag.
	Temporarily enabling more warnings.

2012-06-12 Kamil Ignacak
	* escape codes: until now, whenever client has sent request to
	change tone, cwdaemon has been also resetting volume to default value.
	This has been changed - in such situation volume is not reset, you
	need to send separate escape code to change volume.

2012-06-11 Kamil Ignacak
	* options: implementing option '-T', setting initial tone used by
	cwdaemon.

2012-06-10 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: introducing directories "src" and "doc", moving few
	files to the directories.

2012-06-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* audio system: improving selection/control of audio system: user can
	now specify (through command line arguments or through control data
	sent via socket) audio system: OSS, ALSA or PulseAudio (in addition to
	options available until now: console, soundcard, none).

	* It seems that all changes from Jenö have been added to source code
	three. Proceeding with small improvements and comments.

	* Jenö Vágó has sent me a set of changes that he has made to cwdaemon.
	The changes improve cwdaemon in many ways and have been tested by
	Jenö during his work with cwdaemon. I owe him many thanks for the
	changes and for insightful comments about the application and about
	operation of HAM stations in general.
	During application of the changes to git source tree I have also
	modified formatting, spaces, names and other minor items. I think
	that I've applied all changes, but I will check this again later.

2012-04-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* general: committing files from cwdaemon_0.9.4.orig.tar.gz and
	cwdaemon_0.9.4-9.debian.tar.gz to git repository on Sourceforge.
