2016-03-29 Kamil Ignacak
	* applying two fixes coming from Colin Tuckley (Debian Developer)

2015-10-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* updating files in debian/ directory

2015-09-24 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: fixing two problems (one compilation error and one
	warning) in cwdaemon.c after tests on Alpine Linux.

2015-09-22 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: small improvements after next round of running test
	scripts.

2015-08-10 Kamil Ignacak
	* test: adding test/cwtest_esc5.{pl|sh} files that are used to
	test cwdaemon's response to <Esc>5 escape request (asking cwdaemon
	to exit).

2015-08-09 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: adding test/cwtest_short_space.pl test file checking for
	"short space" problem in libcw. The problem causes cwdaemon to
	hang on space character in some circumstances. The fix for this
	problem should be implemented in libcw, the test only checks that
	libcw has this fix implemented.

2015-08-08 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: adding test/cwtest_esc7.pl file with tests for <ESC>7
	requests.  adding test/cwtest_escf.pl file with tests for <ESC>f
	requests.

2015-08-02 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: adding test/cwtest_esc2.pl file with tests for <ESC>2
	requests.

2015-07-29 Kamil Ignacak
	* examples and tests: moving some files from test/ to examples/.
	The goal is on one hand to have small set of very simple examples
	that can be used by some users to create their own applications
	interfacing cwdaemon, and on the other hand to have coherent set
	of tests that can be used by me to get the best test coverage. The
	tests will be implemented in Perl only (so no duplication of tests
	written in C and in Perl).
	Updating built system files accordingly.

2015-07-02 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: improving test/cwtest.pl. There is one additional small
	test, but the most important change is using randomly generated
	input data. Additionally refactoring of code (some code moved to
	Perl modules; overall improvements) and adding support for command
	line arguments to the test script.

2014-04-22 Kamil Ignacak
	* src/cwdaemon.c: fixes of problems reported by Pino Zollo
	ZP4KFX. See NEWS entry of cwdaemon 0.10.1 for more details.
	* doc/cwdaemon.8.in: fixes of two problems (one of them reported
	by Pino Zollo ZP4KFX).
	* updating debian/* files

2014-01-09 Kamil Ignacak
	Fixed one issue with switching sound systems.  When a network
	request for changing sound system is received, and cwdaemon tries
	to switch to the sound system but fails, it then attempts to fall
	back to "Null" sound system. Opening a "Null" sound system isn't
	very complicated, so it should succeed. We may not have a working
	sound, but at least cwdaemon won't attempt to ask for audio on a
	closed (un-opened) sound system.

2014-01-08 Kamil Ignacak
	Changing cwdaemon's version from 0.9.7 to 0.10.
	Updating year in copyright notice.

2014-01-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* ptt delay: changes in how 'd' request is handled. Until now when
	value sent in request was negative, the delay has been set to
	MAX. Now the negative value is ignored when handling request, and
	causes exit() when handling command line arg.

2014-01-02 Kamil Ignacak
	* audio systems: Making the daemon quit on invalid audio system on
	startup.
	If cwdaemon is started with invalid/unsupported/non-available
	audio system (either specified in command line, or the default
	one), it exits.  Until now the daemon continued to run even if
	audio system was misconfigured. Now it exits.  Code handling
	unsuccessful reconfiguration/change of audio system through
	network request has not been changed (the daemon should continue
	to work, at least in theory).

2014-01-02 Kamil Ignacak
	* debug: Adding new recognized values for "debug file" command
	line option.
	Debug output can be now redirected to stderr, thanks to new
	supported special value "stderr" passed to command line option.
	I've also made sure that "syslog" value is reserved for future use
	(for now it is rejected).

2013-12-28 Kamil Ignacak
	* cwdevice: the new default cwdevice is "null". It is a default
	device at startup (thanks to new function
	cwdaemon_cwdevice_init()), unless it is changed through command
	line, or until it is changed through network request. It is also a
	default fallback device if something goes wrong when changing the
	cwdevice using network request.
	The fact that "null" is the new default doesn't mean that you have
	to change the way you invoke cwdaemon. It just means that the
	variable describing cwdevice is no longer a NULL pointer waiting
	to be properly initiated (or not) by command line argument or
	network request. The variable now references to "null" device by
	default, from start, so there is no risk of using NULL pointer.

2013-12-26 Kamil Ignacak
	* configuration: adding test of cwdevice desciption passed either
	through command line (-d/--cwdevice <name>) or through network
	(<ESC>8<name>). Empty device descriptions are now discarded and
	shouldn't cause crash of daemon anymore.

2013-12-22 Kamil Ignacak
	* configuration: Unification of configuration via command line and
	through socket.

	Parameters of cwdaemon can be changed using either command line
	switches, or requests sent through socket. Some of parameters can
	be changed using both ways. Handling the two ways is implemented
	in two different places, and some code was duplicated.
	I have reused some functions that handled only command line
	arguments to also handle requests sent through pipe.
	I have also modified some debug messages printed on receiving
	invalid configuration values, so that the messages have similar
	format.

2013-12-21 Kamil Ignacak
	* command line options: added support for --long-options.

2013-12-20 Kamil Ignacak
	* debug code: symblic names as verbosity debug levels;
	cwdaemon_debug() now can write to stdout and to disc file;
	cwdaemon_debug() accepts __line__ and __FILE__. Three new command
	line options related to debugging (verbosity level, libcw debug
	flags, output debug file).

2013-12-17 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: renaming configure.in to configure.ac Making some
	other small changes so that current source code (which - so far -
	is still 0.9.7) can build without warnings.
	* debian/* files: upgrading content of control and init.d files to
	cleanly build Debian package.

	Since now I have a cleanly "buildable" source code tree, I can
	proceed with hacking the code.

2012-12-30 Kamil Ignacak
	* testing: improving test/cwtest.pl script - more test cases,
	checking replies from server, multiple repetitions of test cases
	in a loop.
	* functionality: restoring functionality from 0.9.4: reply from
	cwdaemon to a "<ESC>h" escape request starts with character "h".
	This small piece of functionality was missing from post-0.9.4
	releases.

2012-12-29 Kamil Ignacak
	* <ESC>h Some changes that fix problems related to callback
	mechanism replying to <ESC>h sequence. The problems were reported
	by Thomas Beierlein (thank you!).

2012-11-18 Kamil Ignacak
	* <ESC>30 is setting volume to zero, but it was impossible to re-set
	the volume to non-zero value (e.g. with <ESC>3440). This now has been
	fixed. The problem has been reported by Thomas Beierlein (thanks!).

2012-07-04 Kamil Ignacak
	* after performing some tests it turned out that cwdaemon sends
	malformed replies; three changes in src/cwdaemon.c fix this
	problem;

2012-07-03 Kamil Ignacak
	* preparing cwdaemon for new release - few updates in various files.

2012-06-18 Kamil Ignacak
	* audio: it was possible in previous versions of cwdaemon that after
	forking cwdaemon didn't produce any sound. This is now fixed.
	* tests: further clean up in 'test/': removing binary files.

2012-06-17 Kamil Ignacak
	* tests: somewhere around 17.06 I have cleaned up a bit contents of
	'test/'; Two *.c files have been merged into one, Makefile files have
	been added.

2012-06-16 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: added "-std=C99" compilation flag.
	Temporarily enabling more warnings.

2012-06-12 Kamil Ignacak
	* escape codes: until now, whenever client has sent request to
	change tone, cwdaemon has been also resetting volume to default value.
	This has been changed - in such situation volume is not reset, you
	need to send separate escape code to change volume.

2012-06-11 Kamil Ignacak
	* options: implementing option '-T', setting initial tone used by
	cwdaemon.

2012-06-10 Kamil Ignacak
	* build system: introducing directories "src" and "doc", moving few
	files to the directories.

2012-06-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* audio system: improving selection/control of audio system: user can
	now specify (through command line arguments or through control data
	sent via socket) audio system: OSS, ALSA or PulseAudio (in addition to
	options available until now: console, soundcard, none).

2012-06-04 Kamil Ignacak
	* It seems that all changes from Jenö have been added to source code
	three. Proceeding with small improvements and comments.

2012-06-04 Kamil Ignacak
	* Jenö Vágó has sent me a set of changes that he has made to cwdaemon.
	The changes improve cwdaemon in many ways and have been tested by
	Jenö during his work with cwdaemon. I owe him many thanks for the
	changes and for insightful comments about the application and about
	operation of HAM stations in general.
	During application of the changes to git source tree I have also
	modified formatting, spaces, names and other minor items. I think
	that I've applied all changes, but I will check this again later.

2012-04-05 Kamil Ignacak
	* general: committing files from cwdaemon_0.9.4.orig.tar.gz and
	cwdaemon_0.9.4-9.debian.tar.gz to git repository on Sourceforge.
	* patching: applying patches from debian/patches:
	01-Removed-bashism-from-cwsetup.patch by Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>
	02-libcw3-transition.patch by Kamil Ignacak <acerion@wp.pl>
