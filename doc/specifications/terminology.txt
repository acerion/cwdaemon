This document specifies terminology to be used in cwdaemon project.
Consistent use of unambiguous terminology should make writing
comments, messages, specification and other documentation easier.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------




message

Data exchanged between cwdaemon and client application over the
network. It may be either "request" or "reply".

The word should be avoided, as it is ambiguous: it can mean both
request and reply, a content of request or reply, or any other generic
data sent between any entities.




request

Message sent by client application to cwdaemon.




reply

Message sent back by cwdaemon to client application.




text

A string of ASCII characters that should be converted to Morse code.
A text is usually sent by client application to cwdaemon in a request.
A text can be keyed or played.




keying

Manipulating state of HAM transceiver input to transmit a Morse
code. The manipulation is performed through a pin of PC hardware
port. Input data for keying process is a text, hence text is usually
being keyed by cwdaemon. Keying is one of primary roles of cwdaemon.




playing

Converting given text into audible form of Morse code. cwdaemon can
access Operating System's audio system through libcw. Playing a text
is only a secondary role of cwdaemon.
