.TH CWDAEMON 8

.SH NAME
cwdaemon \- morse daemon for the serial or parallel port

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cwdaemon [options] ...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cwdaemon is a small daemon which uses the pc parallel or serial port and a
simple transistor switch to output morse code to a transmitter from a text
message sent to it via udp port 6789.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-cwdevice <device>\fR Use a different device for keying.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR Show summary of options.
.TP
\fB\-n, \-\-nofork\fR Do not fork and print debug information to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-p, \-\-port <port>\fR Use a different UDP port number (default = 6789).
.TP
\fB\-P, \-\-priority <priority>\fR Set cwdaemon priority, -20 to 20 (default = 0).
.TP
\fB\-s, \-\-wpm <speed>\fR Set speed, value larger than 4 (default = 24).
.TP
\fB\-t, \-\-pttdelay <time>\fR Set PTT delay, value from 0 to 50 ms (default = 0).
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-volume <volume>\fR Set volume for soundcard output.
.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR Output version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-w, \-\-weighting <weight>\fR Set weighting, value from -50 to 50 (default = 0).
.TP
\fB\-x, \-\-system <sound system>\fR Set sound system to be used.
.TP
\fB\-T, \-\-tone <tone>\fR Set initial tone, value in range 0 to 4000 Hz (default = 800).
.TP
\fB\-i\fR Increase verbosity of debug messages printed by cwademon. Repeat for even more verbosity.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbosity <level>\fR Set level of verbosity of debug messages printed by cwdaemon.
.TP
\fB\-I, \-\-libcwflags <flags>\fR Numeric value of debug flags to be passed to libcw.
.TP
\fB\-f, \-\-debugfile <path>\fR Print debug information to file instead of stdout. Also works when cwdaemon has forked.


.SH DEVICES
Any serial device that supports getting and setting the modem
control lines can be used.  On Linux, ttyS0, ttyS1, etc. will
work.  On FreeBSD these devices are known as ttyd0, ttyd1, etc.
On OpenBSD, these same devices are known as tty00, tty01, etc.,
but may vary with platform.

For parallel ports on Linux try parport0 (default) or parport1, and on
FreeBSD, ppi0 (default), ppi1, etc.  OpenBSD does not support parallel
port operation, and defaults to 'tty00'.

For completeness, a dummy 'null' device is provided.  This device does
exactly nothing (no rig keying, no ssb keying, etc.).



.SH "SOUND SYSTEM"
\'sound system\' should be one of following:
.TP
\'c\' - console buzzer (PC speaker) - default system,
.TP
\'o\' - OSS,
.TP
\'a\' - ALSA,
.TP
\'p\' - PulseAudio,
.TP
\'n\' - none - no audio,
.TP
\'s\' - soundcard - autoselect from OSS/ALSA/PulseAudio.


.SH "VERBOSITY LEVEL"
Value of \'level\' argument should be one of following:
.TP
\'n\' - none (default)
.TP
\'e\' - errors
.TP
\'w\' - warnings
.TP
\'i\' - information
.TP
\'d\' - debug (details)

.P
By default cwdaemon doesn't print any debug information (level of
verbosity is none). Increasing it to e.g. warnings makes cwdaemon
print all messages that have verbosity level no larger than warning,
i.e. errors and warnings.
