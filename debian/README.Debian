cwdaemon for Debian
-------------------
The README for this package is in /usr/share/cwdaemon.

I case you are using the debian package and want to make changes
to the initial startup settings of cwdaemon, please change
/etc/default/cwdaemon. 
Restart cwdaemon after making changes with the command
'/etc/init.d/cwdaemon restart'.

I am also the upstream maintainer for cwdaemon.
