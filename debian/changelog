    a VHF contest logging program, see http://tucnak.nagano.cz.
  * Debian init.d bootscript added by Lada, together with /etc/default/cwdaemon,
    which you can use to configure cwdaemon. Set START_CWDAEMON=no in
    /etc/default/cwdaemon to disable start at boottime.

    BSD fixes thanks to Diane Bruce, VA3DB.

cwdaemon (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cwdaemon is now integrated with unixcw, see cwlib.c and cwlib.h.
    Weighting has been added to unixcw and some special characters needed
    by cwdaemon. The choppiness reported in previous versions of cwdaemon is
    fixed. And we have soundcard support!
  * Better handling of aborting messages.
  * Weighting now uses a value of -50 to 50.
  * 2 extra command line options: -v for volume and -x for sound device.
  * 2 extra escape sequences for controlling cwdaemon: ESCfx for switching the
    sound output on the fly and ESCgx for setting the soundcard volume.
  * Tune (ESCc) now uses seconds as an argument, e.g. ESCc1 tunes 1 second,
    ESCc10 tunes 10 seconds. Maximum tune value is 10 seconds.
  * A fix by Lada, OK1ZIA for big endian systems.
  * Footswitch support by Wolf, DL2WRJ (pin 15 of the parallel port).
  * New morse character '@' has been added.
  * Process priority of cwdaemon can be set with the -P flag. You can try this
    if you experience timing problems.

    Patch by Rein Couperus, PA0R.

    microphone, uses ESCb escape code.
  * Lada has also split the code into separate files for the serial and
    parallel port.
  * Buffer overflows were fixed.
  * New escape codes: ESC8: device type, ESC9: base port number.
  * Work by Rolf, DL2WRJ:
  * ESCa: PTT on/off, ESCc: tuning on/off, ESCd: PTT delay.

cwdaemon (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for /dev/lp1 parallel port added.

    from an application using ESC7. Values are from -5 to 5. Contributed by
    DL2WRJ.
  * Speed in/decrease is set at 2 wpm intervals.
  * Halfspace delay has been added, which simply adds half of the dash time
    to the delay after each sign send. You have to use the '~' for that.
    See the README. Contributed by DL2WRJ. Thanks Wolf!
  * New serial schematic with port protection and better keying.
  * Also build a debian package on alpha.

  * New function: errmsg for writing to the syslog or console when not forked.
  * Getopt is now used for command line parsing. Some checks added for correct
    UDP port values.
  * The dot-dash delay has been adjusted, so it sounds a bit better.

    now be changed with '-p', '-n' will cause cwdaemon not to fork and print
    debug information to stdout.
  * Many cleanups (up till here 0.2.2 test release).
  * Fixed a divide by zero which would crash cwdaemon.
