Here is a release plan for future versions of cwdaemon:

1.0: - Add support for straight key input, the functionality is already there, 
       see cwlib.c.
     - Parallel port paddle input.

PATCHES
-------
The patches directory containes patches which did not make it (yet) into this
cwdaemon release.

1) Sergei's patch for version 0.5 which adds parallel port paddle input.
2) A large patch from Lada, OK1ZIA, to eliminate delays in version 0.7.
   Lada sent me his patch just before I released 0.8beta1. There were so many
   changes in this beta, that lada's patch could not be applied.
3) Another patch by Lada, to improve aborting of Morse while sending. A better
   solution was found by using the select() function.
