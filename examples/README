In this directory there are three examples of how to interface
cwdaemon. You can treat them as hints about how to write an
application interfacing cwdaemon.

example.sh is the most simple one, using nc to do the job - you can
enter text from keyboard to send it to cwdaemon.

example.c (accompanied by 'make' files) is an example program in C.

example.pl is an example script in Perl 5.
