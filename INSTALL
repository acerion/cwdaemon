You will need to have the the libcw6 library and header files
installed to compile and install cwdaemon 0.10.2.

libcw is a part of unicw package which can be found here:
http://unixcw.sourceforge.net/

After installing libcw6 development files do:

1: ./configure
2: make
3: make install (as root)

Before doing step 1, you may need to update your PKG_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable so that it contains location of libcw.pc file.

The cwdaemon program is installed in /usr/local/sbin.

See the provided README for more details. The manual page will tell you
some more about startup options, you could also type cwdaemon -h.
