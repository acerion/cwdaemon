You will need to have the the libcw8 library and header files from unixcw
3.6.1 package installed to compile and install cwdaemon 0.13.0.

http://unixcw.sourceforge.net/

After installing libcw development files do:

1. (optional) update your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable so that it
   contains location of libcw.pc file.

   Example:
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/kamil/compilations/lib/pkgconfig/

2. (optional) update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that it
   contains location of libcw shared library.

   Example:
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/kamil/compilations/lib/

3. ./configure
4. make
5. make install # (as root)

The cwdaemon program is installed in /usr/local/sbin.

See the provided README for more details. The manual page will tell you
