You will need to have the the libcw8 library and header files from unixcw
3.6.1 package installed to compile and install cwdaemon 0.13.0. libcw7 from
unixcw 3.6.0 may also work, but I didn't test cwdaemon with that version of
libcw.

libcw is a part of unixcw package which can be found here:
http://unixcw.sourceforge.net/

After installing libcw development files do:

1. (optional) update your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable so that it
   contains location of libcw.pc file.

   Example:
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/kamil/compilations/lib/pkgconfig/

2. (optional) update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that it
   contains location of libcw shared library.

   Example:
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/kamil/compilations/lib/

3. ./configure
4. make
5. make install # (as root)

The cwdaemon program is installed in /usr/local/sbin.
