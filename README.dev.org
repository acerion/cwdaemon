1. Test a cwdaewmon process that is running as system service

cwdaemon is installed on target OS and is executed as system daemon. This
means that it may behave differently than when started by hand from build
directory.

One example of a different behaviour is accessing PulseAudio: cwdaemon
started by hand by developer has no problems with opening PulseAudio sink,
but when started as system service by systemd, it can't open PulseAudio sink.

* RULES

You SHOULD use "command line",
You MUST NOT use "commandline".
You MAY use "command-line".

You SHOULD start debug messages with capital letters. Example ("Invalid" is the first word in the message):
    "[ERROR] cwdaemon: Invalid value of option for keying device (expected 'key|ptt=RTS|DTR|none'): [ke=none]"

** BUGS
*** PulseAudio for system services

Summary:
cwdaemon started by systemd can't open PulseAudio sound sink.

Reproduction steps:
 1. Build and install libcw 7.0,
 2. Build and install cwdaemon 0.11.0 or 0.12.0
 3. Modify operating systems's init scripts to start the cwdaemon
 4. Modify /etc/default/cwdaemon to use PulseAudio
 4. systemctl start cwdaemon

If you set sound system in cwdaemon's config to "p" (PulseAudio) then
cwdaemon/libcw will have problems opening the sound sink.

You can also see this when you start "cwdaemon -n -x p" by hand as root.

This is probably a bug in libcw, but I'm putting it here because it was found
during work on cwdaemon and I didn't investigate it in libcw yet.
*** Makefiles in deb/usr/share/cwdaemon
The dir in deb package contains Makefile.am and Makefile.in, which are pretty
useless for end-user. It would be better to have just a simple Makefile in
that location.


** FEATURES
*** Add printing of specific envs

Print XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and perhaps something else, but only
if you enable it explicitly in code (#ifdef 0 by default).

This feature may help in debugging different problems.

I had to modify test code (extend env table of process) in order to avoid
problems with PulseAudio.

*** Pin assignments
Look at possibility to re-define pin assignments.
