** BUGS
*** PulseAudio for system services

Summary:
cwdaemon started by systemd can't open PulseAudio sound sink.

Reproduction steps:
 1. Build and install libcw 7.0,
 2. Build and install cwdaemon 0.11.0 or 0.12.0
 3. Modify operating systems's init scripts to start the cwdaemon
 4. Modify /etc/default/cwdaemon to use PulseAudio
 4. systemctl start cwdaemon

If you set sound system in cwdaemon's config to "p" (PulseAudio) then
cwdaemon/libcw will have problems opening the sound sink.

You can also see this when you start "cwdaemon -n -x p" by hand as root.

This is probably a bug in libcw, but I'm putting it here because it was found
during work on cwdaemon and I didn't investigate it in libcw yet.
